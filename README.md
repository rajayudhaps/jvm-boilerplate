Polyglot boilerplate of JVM based programming languages using dependency managements.


The boilerplate will contains and supports some JVM based programming languages which are **Java, Kotlin and Clojure** using **Apache Maven** as dependency management for now. In the future, we will add **Gradle** as other alternative for **Apache Maven**.

You can mix the implementation your project without many setup needed using this boilerplate. 


## To Be Done in the Future

There some enhancement and additional feature will be added in the future in this boilerplate:

- [X] Add Deployment to Sonatype (Maven Repository)
- [ ] Add multi-module support
- [ ] Add Gradle support
- [ ] Add other design pattern implementations
- [ ] Add Scala and Groovy (still on reasearch step)
